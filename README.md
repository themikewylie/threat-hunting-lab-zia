# Threat Hunting Lab – ZIA

Welcome to the official lab environment for:

## **Hands-On Threat Hunt: Building a Dynamic Hunt Program**

This interactive lab walks you through building a repeatable threat hunting methodology using real-world style secure web gateway (ZIA-style) proxy logs.

This is **not** a canned demo.
You will:

* Establish baselines
* Identify anomalies
* Use Least Frequency of Occurrence (LFO)
* Develop and test hypotheses
* Defend your findings

---

# Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

* Build a structured hunt workflow
* Identify thin-tail anomalies in large datasets
* Hunt for suspicious HTTP/HTTPS behaviors
* Translate findings into detection opportunities
* Operationalize hunt outcomes into program improvements

---
