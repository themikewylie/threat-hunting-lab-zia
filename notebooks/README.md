# Notebooks Directory

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks used throughout the Threat Hunting Lab.

These notebooks guide you through structured, hands-on analysis of secure web proxy (ZIA-style) telemetry using Python and pandas.

# Purpose of the Notebooks

The notebooks are designed to help you:

* Explore and understand the dataset
* Establish behavioral baselines
* Apply Least Frequency of Occurrence (LFO)
* Develop and test hunting hypotheses
* Investigate anomalies
* Validate findings

---


# How to Approach the Notebooks

Do not simply run cells sequentially.

Instead:

* Read the objective for each section
* Form a hypothesis before executing analysis
* Ask investigative questions
* Validate results with additional pivots
* Document your findings

Threat hunting is not linear.

The notebooks provide structure — your thinking drives the investigation.

# Technical Notes

These notebooks use:

* Python 3
* pandas
* Standard data manipulation and grouping techniques

If a notebook fails to execute:

* Restart the kernel
* Re-run from the top
* Confirm dataset paths are correct

---

# Expected Outcome

By the end of these notebooks, you should be able to:

* Identify normal vs. unexpected activity
* Detect thin-tail anomalies in large datasets
* Translate findings into detection opportunities
* Articulate investigative reasoning clearly

Happy hunting!
