       "      <td>Note: This repository contains Anthropic's implementation of skills for Claude. For information about the Agent Skills standard, see agentskills.io . Skills Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude loads dynamically to improve performance on specialized tasks. Skills teach Claude how to complete specific tasks in a repeatable way, whether that's creating documents with your company's brand guidelines, analyzing data using your organization's specific workflows, or automating personal tasks. For more information, check out: What are skills? Using skills in Claude How to create custom skills Equipping agents for the real world with Agent Skills About This Repository This repository contains skills that demonstrate what's possible with Claude's skills system. These skills range from creative applications (art, music, design) to technical tasks (testing web apps, MCP server generation) to enterprise workflows (communications, branding, etc.). Each skill is self-contained in its own folder with a SKILL.md file containing the instructions and metadata that Claude uses. Browse through these skills to get inspiration for your own skills or to understand different patterns and approaches. Many skills in this repo are open source (Apache 2.0). We've also included the document creation &amp; editing skills that power Claude's document capabilities under the hood in the skills/docx , skills/pdf , skills/pptx , and skills/xlsx subfolders. These are source-available, not open source, but we wanted to share these with developers as a reference for more complex skills that are actively used in a production AI application. Disclaimer These skills are provided for demonstration and educational purposes only. While some of these capabilities may be available in Claude, the implementations and behaviors you receive from Claude may differ from what is shown in these skills. These skills are meant to illustrate patterns and possibilities. Always test skills thoroughly in your own environment before relying on them for critical tasks. Skill Sets ./skills : Skill examples for Creative &amp; Design, Development &amp; Technical, Enterprise &amp; Communication, and Document Skills ./spec : The Agent Skills specification ./template : Skill template Try in Claude Code, Claude.ai, and the API Claude Code You can register this repository as a Claude Code Plugin marketplace by running the following command in Claude Code: /plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills Then, to install a specific set of skills: Select Browse and install plugins Select anthropic-agent-skills Select document-skills or example-skills Select Install now Alternatively, directly install either Plugin via: /plugin install document-skills@anthropic-agent-skills /plugin install example-skills@anthropic-agent-skills After installing the plugin, you can use the skill by just mentioning it. For instance, if you install the document-skills plugin from the marketplace, you can ask Claude Code to do something like: \"Use the PDF skill to extract the form fields from path/to/some-file.pdf \" Claude.ai These example skills are all already available to paid plans in Claude.ai. To use any skill from this repository or upload custom skills, follow the instructions in Using skills in Claude . Claude API You can use Anthropic's pre-built skills, and upload custom skills, via the Claude API. See the Skills API Quickstart for more. Creating a Basic Skill Skills are simple to create - just a folder with a SKILL.md file containing YAML frontmatter and instructions. You can use the template-skill in this repository as a starting point: --- name : my-skill-name description : A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it --- # My Skill Name [ Add your instructions here that Claude will follow when this skill is active ] ## Examples - Example usage 1 - Example usage 2 ## Guidelines - Guideline 1 - Guideline 2 The frontmatter requires only two fields: name - A unique identifier for your skill (lowercase, hyphens for spaces) description - A complete description of what the skill does and when to use it The markdown content below contains the instructions, examples, and guidelines that Claude will follow. For more details, see How to create custom skills . Partner Skills Skills are a great way to teach Claude how to get better at using specific pieces of software.

Remote state can be uploaded to a GCS bucket. Connect between resources with terraform_remote_state (local and bucket). Save tf / json files using a custom folder tree pattern. Import by resource name and type. Support terraform 0.13 (for terraform 0.11 use v0.7.9). Terraformer uses Terraform providers and is designed to easily support newly added resources. To upgrade resources with new fields, all you need to do is upgrade the relevant Terraform providers. Import current state to Terraform configuration from a provider Usage: import [provider] [flags] import [provider] [command] Available Commands: list List supported resources for a provider Flags: -b, --bucket string gs://terraform-state -c, --connect (default true) -С, --compact (default false) -x, --excludes strings firewalls,networks -f, --filter strings compute_firewall=id1:id2:id4 -h, --help help for google -O, --output string output format hcl or json (default \"hcl\") -o, --path-output string (default \"generated\") -p, --path-pattern string {output}/{provider}/ (default \"{output}/{provider}/{service}/\") --projects strings -z, --regions strings europe-west1, (default [global]) -r, --resources strings firewall,networks or * for all services -s, --state string local or bucket (default \"local\") -v, --verbose verbose mode -n, --retry-number number of retries to perform if refresh fails -m, --retry-sleep-ms time in ms to sleep between retries Use \" import [provider] [command] --help\" for more information about a command. Permissions The tool requires read-only permissions to list service resources. Resources You can use --resources parameter to tell resources from what service you want to import. To import resources from all services, use --resources=\"*\" . If you want to exclude certain services, you can combine the parameter with --excludes to exclude resources from services you don't want to import e.g. --resources=\"*\" --excludes=\"iam\" . Filtering Filters are a way to choose which resources terraformer imports. It's possible to filter resources by its identifiers or attributes. Multiple filtering values are separated by : . If an identifier contains this symbol, value should be wrapped in ' e.g. --filter=resource=id1:'project:dataset_id' . Identifier based filters will be executed before Terraformer will try to refresh remote state. Use Type when you need to filter only one of several types of resources. Multiple filters can be combined when importing different resource types. An example would be importing all AWS security groups from a specific AWS VPC: terraformer import aws -r sg,vpc --filter Type=sg;Name=vpc_id;Value=VPC_ID --filter Type=vpc;Name=id;Value=VPC_ID Notice how the Name is different for sg than it is for vpc . Migration state version For terraform &gt;= 0.13, you can use replace-provider to migrate state from previous versions. Example usage: terraform state replace-provider -auto-approve \"registry.terraform.io/-/aws\" \"hashicorp/aws\" Resource ID Filtering is based on Terraform resource ID patterns. To find valid ID patterns for your resource, check the import part of the Terraform documentation . Example usage: terraformer import aws --resources=vpc,subnet --filter=vpc=myvpcid --regions=eu-west-1 Will only import the vpc with id myvpcid . This form of filters can help when it's necessary to select resources by its identifiers. Field name only It is possible to filter by specific field name only. It can be used e.g. when you want to retrieve resources only with a specific tag key. Example usage: terraformer import aws --resources=s3 --filter=\"Name=tags.Abc\" --regions=eu-west-1 Will only import the s3 resources that have tag Abc . This form of filters can help when the field values are not important from filtering perspective. Field with dots It is possible to filter by a field that contains a dot. Example usage: terraformer import aws --resources=s3 --filter=\"Name=tags.Abc.def\" --regions=eu-west-1 Will only import the s3 resources that have tag Abc.def . Planning The plan command generates a planfile that contains all the resources set to be imported. By modifying the planfile before running the import command, you can rename or filter the resources you'd like to import. The rest of subcommands and parameters are identical to the import command. $ terraformer plan google --resources=networks,firewall --projects=my-project --regions=europe-west1-d (snip) Saving planfile to generated/google/my-project/terraformer/plan.json After reviewing/customizing the planfile, begin the import by running import plan . $ terraformer import plan generated/google/my-project/terraformer/plan.json Resource structure Terraformer by default separates each resource into a file, which is put into a given service directory. The default path for resource files is {output}/{provider}/{service}/{resource}.tf and can vary for each provider. It's possible to adjust the generated structure by: Using --compact parameter to group resource files within a single service into one resources.tf file Adjusting the --path-pattern parameter and passing e.g. --path-pattern {output}/{provider}/ to generate resources for all services in one directory It's possible to combine --compact --path-pattern parameters together. Installation Both Terraformer and a Terraform provider plugin need to be installed. Terraformer From a package manager Homebrew users can use brew install terraformer . MacPorts users can use sudo port install terraformer . Chocolatey users can use choco install terraformer .

       "      <td>Documentation TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools , libraries , and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working within the Machine Intelligence team at Google Brain to conduct research in machine learning and neural networks. However, the framework is versatile enough to be used in other areas as well. TensorFlow provides stable Python and C++ APIs, as well as a non-guaranteed backward compatible API for other languages . Keep up-to-date with release announcements and security updates by subscribing to announce@tensorflow.org . See all the mailing lists . Install See the TensorFlow install guide for the pip package , to enable GPU support , use a Docker container , and build from source . To install the current release, which includes support for CUDA-enabled GPU cards (Ubuntu and Windows) : $ pip install tensorflow Other devices (DirectX and MacOS-metal) are supported using Device Plugins . A smaller CPU-only package is also available: $ pip install tensorflow-cpu To update TensorFlow to the latest version, add --upgrade flag to the above commands. Nightly binaries are available for testing using the tf-nightly and tf-nightly-cpu packages on PyPI. Try your first TensorFlow program $ python &gt; &gt;&gt; import tensorflow as tf &gt; &gt;&gt; tf . add ( 1 , 2 ). numpy () 3 &gt; &gt;&gt; hello = tf . constant ( 'Hello, TensorFlow!' ) &gt; &gt;&gt; hello . numpy () b'Hello, TensorFlow!'

For information about the Agent Skills standard, see agentskills.io . Skills Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude loads dynamically to improve performance on specialized tasks. Skills teach Claude how to complete specific tasks in a repeatable way, whether that's creating documents with your company's brand guidelines, analyzing data using your organization's specific workflows, or automating personal tasks.

Using skills in Claude How to create custom skills Equipping agents for the real world with Agent Skills About This Repository This repository contains skills that demonstrate what's possible with Claude's skills system. These skills range from creative applications (art, music, design) to technical tasks (testing web apps, MCP server generation) to enterprise workflows (communications, branding, etc.). Each skill is self-contained in its own folder with a SKILL.md file containing the instructions and metadata that Claude uses. Browse through these skills to get inspiration for your own skills or to understand different patterns and approaches. Many skills in this repo are open source (Apache 2.0). We've also included the document creation & editing skills that power Claude's document capabilities under the hood in the skills/docx , skills/pdf , skills/pptx , and skills/xlsx subfolders. These are source-available, not open source, but we wanted to share these with developers as a reference for more complex skills that are actively used in a production AI application. Disclaimer These skills are provided for demonstration and educational purposes only. While some of these capabilities may be available in Claude, the implementations and behaviors you receive from Claude may differ from what is shown in these skills. These skills are meant to illustrate patterns and possibilities. Always test skills thoroughly in your own environment before relying on them for critical tasks. Skill Sets ./skills : Skill examples for Creative & Design, Development & Technical, Enterprise & Communication, and Document Skills ./spec : The Agent Skills specification ./template : Skill template Try in Claude Code, Claude.ai, and the API Claude Code You can register this repository as a Claude Code Plugin marketplace by running the following command in Claude Code: /plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills Then, to install a specific set of skills: Select Browse and install plugins Select anthropic-agent-skills Select document-skills or example-skills Select Install now Alternatively, directly install either Plugin via: /plugin install document-skills@anthropic-agent-skills /plugin install example-skills@anthropic-agent-skills After installing the plugin, you can use the skill by just mentioning it. For instance, if you install the document-skills plugin from the marketplace, you can ask Claude Code to do something like: \"Use the PDF skill to extract the form fields from path/to/some-file.pdf \" Claude.ai These example skills are all already available to paid plans in Claude.ai. To use any skill from this repository or upload custom skills, follow the instructions in Using skills in Claude . Claude API You can use Anthropic's pre-built skills, and upload custom skills, via the Claude API. See the Skills API Quickstart for more. Creating a Basic Skill Skills are simple to create - just a folder with a SKILL.md file containing YAML frontmatter and instructions. You can use the template-skill in this repository as a starting point: --- name : my-skill-name description : A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it --- # My Skill Name [ Add your instructions here that Claude will follow when this skill is active ] ## Examples - Example usage 1 - Example usage 2 ## Guidelines - Guideline 1 - Guideline 2 The frontmatter requires only two fields: name - A unique identifier for your skill (lowercase, hyphens for spaces) description - A complete description of what the skill does and when to use it The markdown content below contains the instructions, examples, and guidelines that Claude will follow.

Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug. Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM. Learn Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native . Learn how to use React in your project . Installation React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and you can use as little or as much React as you need : Use Quick Start to get a taste of React. Add React to an Existing Project to use as little or as much React as you need. Create a New React App if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain. Documentation You can find the React documentation on the website . Check out the Getting Started page for a quick overview. The documentation is divided into several sections: Quick Start Tutorial Thinking in React Installation Describing the UI Adding Interactivity Managing State Advanced Guides API Reference Where to Get Support Contributing Guide You can improve it by sending pull requests to this repository . Examples We have several examples on the website . Here is the first one to get you started: import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client' ; function HelloMessage ( { name } ) { return < div > Hello { name } </ div > ; } const root = createRoot ( document . getElementById ( 'container' ) ) ; root . render ( < HelloMessage name = \"Taylor\" /> ) ; This example will render \"Hello Taylor\" into a container on the page. You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; we call it JSX . JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. Contributing The main purpose of this repository is to continue evolving React core, making it faster and easier to use. Development of React happens in the open on GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements. Read below to learn how you can take part in improving React. Code of Conduct Facebook has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the full text so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated. Contributing Guide Read our contributing guide to learn about our development process, how to propose bugfixes and improvements, and how to build and test your changes to React.

       "3  Terraformer A CLI tool that generates tf / json and tfstate files based on existing infrastructure (reverse Terraform).

Remote state can be uploaded to a GCS bucket. Connect between resources with terraform_remote_state (local and bucket). Save tf / json files using a custom folder tree pattern. Import by resource name and type. Support terraform 0.13 (for terraform 0.11 use v0.7.9). Terraformer uses Terraform providers and is designed to easily support newly added resources. To upgrade resources with new fields, all you need to do is upgrade the relevant Terraform providers. Import current state to Terraform configuration from a provider Usage: import [provider] [flags] import [provider] [command] Available Commands: list List supported resources for a provider Flags: -b, --bucket string gs://terraform-state -c, --connect (default true) -С, --compact (default false) -x, --excludes strings firewalls,networks -f, --filter strings compute_firewall=id1:id2:id4 -h, --help help for google -O, --output string output format hcl or json (default \"hcl\") -o, --path-output string (default \"generated\") -p, --path-pattern string {output}/{provider}/ (default \"{output}/{provider}/{service}/\") --projects strings -z, --regions strings europe-west1, (default [global]) -r, --resources strings firewall,networks or * for all services -s, --state string local or bucket (default \"local\") -v, --verbose verbose mode -n, --retry-number number of retries to perform if refresh fails -m, --retry-sleep-ms time in ms to sleep between retries Use \" import [provider] [command] --help\" for more information about a command. Permissions The tool requires read-only permissions to list service resources. Resources You can use --resources parameter to tell resources from what service you want to import. To import resources from all services, use --resources=\"*\" . If you want to exclude certain services, you can combine the parameter with --excludes to exclude resources from services you don't want to import e.g. --resources=\"*\" --excludes=\"iam\" . Filtering Filters are a way to choose which resources terraformer imports. It's possible to filter resources by its identifiers or attributes. Multiple filtering values are separated by : . If an identifier contains this symbol, value should be wrapped in ' e.g. --filter=resource=id1:'project:dataset_id' . Identifier based filters will be executed before Terraformer will try to refresh remote state. Use Type when you need to filter only one of several types of resources. Multiple filters can be combined when importing different resource types. An example would be importing all AWS security groups from a specific AWS VPC: terraformer import aws -r sg,vpc --filter Type=sg;Name=vpc_id;Value=VPC_ID --filter Type=vpc;Name=id;Value=VPC_ID Notice how the Name is different for sg than it is for vpc . Migration state version For terraform >= 0.13, you can use replace-provider to migrate state from previous versions. Example usage: terraform state replace-provider -auto-approve \"registry.terraform.io/-/aws\" \"hashicorp/aws\" Resource ID Filtering is based on Terraform resource ID patterns. To find valid ID patterns for your resource, check the import part of the Terraform documentation . Example usage: terraformer import aws --resources=vpc,subnet --filter=vpc=myvpcid --regions=eu-west-1 Will only import the vpc with id myvpcid . This form of filters can help when it's necessary to select resources by its identifiers. Field name only It is possible to filter by specific field name only. It can be used e.g. when you want to retrieve resources only with a specific tag key. Example usage: terraformer import aws --resources=s3 --filter=\"Name=tags.Abc\" --regions=eu-west-1 Will only import the s3 resources that have tag Abc . This form of filters can help when the field values are not important from filtering perspective. Field with dots It is possible to filter by a field that contains a dot. Example usage: terraformer import aws --resources=s3 --filter=\"Name=tags.Abc.def\" --regions=eu-west-1 Will only import the s3 resources that have tag Abc.def . Planning The plan command generates a planfile that contains all the resources set to be imported. By modifying the planfile before running the import command, you can rename or filter the resources you'd like to import. The rest of subcommands and parameters are identical to the import command. $ terraformer plan google --resources=networks,firewall --projects=my-project --regions=europe-west1-d (snip) Saving planfile to generated/google/my-project/terraformer/plan.json After reviewing/customizing the planfile, begin the import by running import plan . $ terraformer import plan generated/google/my-project/terraformer/plan.json Resource structure Terraformer by default separates each resource into a file, which is put into a given service directory. The default path for resource files is {output}/{provider}/{service}/{resource}.tf and can vary for each provider. It's possible to adjust the generated structure by: Using --compact parameter to group resource files within a single service into one resources.tf file Adjusting the --path-pattern parameter and passing e.g. --path-pattern {output}/{provider}/ to generate resources for all services in one directory It's possible to combine --compact --path-pattern parameters together. Installation Both Terraformer and a Terraform provider plugin need to be installed. Terraformer From a package manager Homebrew users can use brew install terraformer . MacPorts users can use sudo port install terraformer . Chocolatey users can use choco install terraformer . From releases This installs all providers, set PROVIDER to one of google , aws or kubernetes if you only need one.

It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools , libraries , and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working within the Machine Intelligence team at Google Brain to conduct research in machine learning and neural networks. However, the framework is versatile enough to be used in other areas as well. TensorFlow provides stable Python and C++ APIs, as well as a non-guaranteed backward compatible API for other languages . Keep up-to-date with release announcements and security updates by subscribing to announce@tensorflow.org . See all the mailing lists . Install See the TensorFlow install guide for the pip package , to enable GPU support , use a Docker container , and build from source . To install the current release, which includes support for CUDA-enabled GPU cards (Ubuntu and Windows) : $ pip install tensorflow Other devices (DirectX and MacOS-metal) are supported using Device Plugins . A smaller CPU-only package is also available: $ pip install tensorflow-cpu To update TensorFlow to the latest version, add --upgrade flag to the above commands. Nightly binaries are available for testing using the tf-nightly and tf-nightly-cpu packages on PyPI. Try your first TensorFlow program $ python > >> import tensorflow as tf > >> tf . add ( 1 , 2 ). numpy () 3 > >> hello = tf . constant ( 'Hello, TensorFlow!' ) > >> hello . numpy () b'Hello, TensorFlow!'
